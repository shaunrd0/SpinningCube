# SpinningCube
First Android Unity project

A basic Android Application that can be built and played either on a device as a .apk or within the unity editor.

Not a game, but a demonstration of C# scripting within unity.
Good example in terms of simple goal and execution, maybe a bad example in real-world practice.
A learning experience.

The cube spins on the screen at a slow rate initially, as the cube rotates every full rotation grants exp.
Upon leveling up the rotation speed is increased.

Feel free to use the UI buttons to force your speed to ridiculous amounts.
Other fun debugging options in there, as well as changing the color of the cube.

Have fun, feel free to make a pull request.
